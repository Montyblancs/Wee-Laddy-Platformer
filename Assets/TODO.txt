Develop more weapons/pickups for the player
  -Make bullet casings slightly more dynamic
Make a HUD
Make danger indicators for incoming background bullets
Make a flying enemy
Make an enemy that can take multiple hits
Make a multi-part boss enemy (like a robot with a bunch of limbs)
Refine camera movements and control, where possible.
Zoom out the camera a bit, let the player see more.
Apply a small time window where input doesn't effect player movement after a wall jump, to provide slightly easier max-distance wall jumping.
fix bug where the player appears to jitter ever so slightly while moving on platforms.
Decide on a sprite animation system
	-2D : indipendent arms following cusor, 8-way body.
	-3D : full sprites, no aiming animation really needed
Improve HUD, adding some indication of your current weapon/ammo etc.

-Bugfixes
Shotgun spread on flat plane is dependent on cursor distance from player. Make this indipendent.
Get the z position of an object under the cursor when firing at the background to ensure the bullet travels accurately
	-This will allow for objects positioned at multiple different z positions for layering
	-Get the max travel distance if there's nothing under the cursor
Far enemy bullets are max size on first frame, recalculate bullet size on spawn

-Future Ideas
Give each weapon a "super move" meter, which stops time briefly, gives iframes, and performs a charged up attack based on weapon fire type.
